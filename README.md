### What is NLP?
- **NLP** stands for **Natural Language Processing**.
- It is a part of **Artificial Intelligence** that allows computers to **read**, **understand**, and **respond** to human language.
- It connects **language** and **machines**.
- **Example :** Google Assistant, ChatGPT, Siri.
  - We talk to them in English, and they **understand our words** and **give answers**. That's NLP in action.

### Where is NLP Used?
- Chatbots like ChatGPT, Google Gemini
- Voice Assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Google Translate
- Spam Detection in Emails
- Sentiment Analysis in social media
---
### Key Tasks in NLP
- **Tokenization:** Breaking sentences into words
- **Stopword Removal:** Removing common words like "is", "the", "and".
- **Stemming:** Cutting words to their root form (e.g., "playing" → "play")
- **Lemmatization:** Smarter stemming using grammar (e.g., "was" → "be")
- **POS Tagging:** Finding part of speech (noun, verb, etc.)
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Detecting names, places, organizations in text

### Required Python Packages
- **`nltk`**
- **`streamlit`**
---
### How the App Works -
- **Input :**
```
text = "I love learning Natural Language Processing!"
```
- **Output :**
```
["I", "love", "learning", "Natural", "Language", "Processing", "!"]
```
- The sentence is broken down into **tokens** (words and punctuation).
---
### Additional Insights :
- NLP is used in **almost every app** that understands language.
- NLP can be used for **analyzing customer reviews** automatically.
- NLP is the **brain behind chatbots** and auto-translation.
