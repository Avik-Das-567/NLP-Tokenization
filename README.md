### What is NLP?
- **NLP** stands for **Natural Language Processing**.
- It is a part of **Artificial Intelligence** that allows computers to **read**, **understand**, and **respond** to human language.
- It connects **language** and **machines**.
- **Real-Life Example:** Think of **Google Assistant**, **ChatGPT**, or **Siri**. We talk to them in English, and they **understand our words** and **give answers**. That’s NLP in action.
- NLP is used in **almost every app** that understands language. It can be used for **analyzing customer reviews** automatically.
- NLP is the **brain behind chatbots** and auto-translation.

- **Lemmatization:** Smarter stemming using grammar (e.g., "was" → "be")
- **POS Tagging:** Finding part of speech (noun, verb, etc.)
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Detecting names, places, organizations in text
